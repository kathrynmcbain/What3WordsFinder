# What3WordsFinder
Allows user to experiment with three word combinations and see where it is located on a map.

For security reasons, I can't publish my own api key. You must go to https://accounts.what3words.com/register/ to get your own.

When you have a key, create your a javascript file called ApiKey.js and insert the following code:

const config = {
    ApiKey: "<The API Key you just got>"
};
